[] lineage metadata charts
    [x] create computed property for current data (for at least one agg/target)
    [x] plot current data
    [x] get correct initial value for mass
    [x] add all aggregators
    [x] add lineage target
    [x] add track target
    [x] consider switch to candygraph
        - no for now. The most important use case for us has limited lines, so the benefit
        seems limited, and there are risks of this being a small and not fully released
    [x] add axes
    [x] send email with update
    [x] variance
        [x] 90, 95, 99, 100 quantile for median
        [x] 1 std, 2 std, 3std, SE for average
    [] add option for smoothing?
        [] median filter
        [] average filter
    [] interactions
        [] tooltip (cell count)
        [] show lineage
        [] select current time on all charts




[] trrack Integration
[] Validator view
[] move stuff to toolbars, research quasar comps. 


Aggregate line chart view
[] aggregation: min,median, max, avg, total
[] attribute: mass, perimeter
[] for: frame, lineage, (tracks?, would not need aggregator)


Trrack Integration
[] add image selection store
[] add config layout store
[] add track vis

refactor cell meta data to support selecting multiple locations

simple image viewer
    [] fix deckgl crash (probs in loading code)
        [] test with viv recommended server
        [] consider batch loading frames into different layers
        [] maybe this is exposed because of low latency??? (Could try simulating?)
    [] clean up image viewer settings ui
        [] dynamic range text box
        [] toggle visibility
        [] remove extra scrollbars
        [] smart resize?
    [] load entire companion.ome
    [] switch between companion.omes
    [] add center dots
    [] add region outlines


quasar ui updatse
[] switch to quasar table
[] layout/settings panel
[] item list selection for custom layouts
[] change widget container to quasar card

Misc fixes/enhancements
[] improve looneage view recalculation issue
[] fix table scrollbar issue (try switching to q-table)
[] cache large data requests e.g. to tabular data
[] crash when selecting lineage with single length track
[] either remove single column layout, or add special logic for it

Validator component
[] sorted
[] duplicate time

Code cleanup:
[] rename btnLight/btnDark to normalizedLight / normalizedDark.
[] add store to the name of all stores


Uncategorized
[] add slider for lineage height
[] add debug layout
[] add placeholder sliders for filtering
include polynomial curvature as a LLA (lineage level attribute)
create small fake dataset on gh
create (maybe interactive?) legend for horizon chart |/  /  /  /|
add aardvark icon
research filter options (vega, plotly, other)

add close widget option 

add option to filter out parts of tree
add option to select attribute in looneage
add images to looneage view
add extra charts to looneage view
add option to view multiple lineages?

create components
* folder table component (lineage -> track -> cells)
* simple image viewer
* general vis? scatterplot / violin plots?
* debug/util panel
* * LocalStorage.clear()

[x] send emails about datasets
[x] debug/fix: switching datasets crashes now (related to lineageid changes I think)

Refactor cell meta data to support selecting multiple locations
[] break down into smaller tasks

simple image viewer
    [] fix deckgl crash (probs in loading code)
        [] test with viv recommended server
        [] consider batch loading frames into different layers
        [] maybe this is exposed because of low latency??? (Could try simulating?)
    [] clean up image viewer settings ui
        [] dynamic range text box
        [] toggle visibility
        [] remove extra scrollbars
        [] smart resize?
    [] load entire companion.ome
    [] switch between companion.omes
    [] add center dots
    [] add region outlines
    [] add tree in image

Line Chart Interactions
    [] tooltip (cell count)
    [] show lineage
    [] select current time on all charts

Trracking enhancements
[-] image view state to store?
[-] table state (which column sorted, page size, page number)

quasar ui updatse
[] layout/settings panel
[] item list selection for custom layouts
[] change widget container to quasar card
[] potentially move widget actions to toolbar

Misc fixes/enhancements
[] improve looneage view recalculation issue
[] cache large data requests e.g. to tabular data
[x] crash when selecting lineage with single length track
[] either remove single column layout, or add special logic for it

Validator component
[] sorted
[] duplicate time

Code cleanup:
[] rename btnLight/btnDark to normalizedLight / normalizedDark.
[] add store to the name of all stores


Uncategorized
[] add slider for lineage height
[] add debug layout
[] add placeholder sliders for filtering
[] deploy
[] rename windows / storeids in interface
include polynomial curvature as a LLA (lineage level attribute)
create small fake dataset on gh
create (maybe interactive?) legend for horizon chart |/  /  /  /|
add aardvark icon
research filter options (vega, plotly, other)
generic min-size protection
no-data-splash, but with sad aardvarks
add close widget option 

add option to filter out parts of tree
add option to select attribute in looneage
add images to looneage view
add extra charts to looneage view
add option to view multiple lineages?

create components
* folder table component (lineage -> track -> cells)
* simple image viewer
* general vis? scatterplot / violin plots?
* debug/util panel
* * LocalStorage.clear()

# Building and Running Loon From Source

The official Github repository for Loon has everything that is required to build the the docker any of the above docker images. Instead of building a single image, however, you can also use Docker Compose to build our multi-container application. Building the multi-container application instead of the single Docker image provides more insight when attempting to debug and allows for much more configuration. This is done through a build script with an accompanying JSON file.

## Configuration File

Below is the base configuration file that is required to build Loon.

```json
{
  "generalSettings": {
    "useHttp": false,
    "environment": "production",
    "baseUrl": "localhost"
  },
  "mySqlSettings": {
    "databaseName": "loon",
    "databaseUser": "user",
    "databasePassword": "user_pass",
    "databaseRootPassword": "root_pass",
    "sourceVolumeLocation": "/Users/bbollen23/loonar-data/mysql-data"
  },
  "minioSettings": {
    "minioStorageAccessKey": "admin",
    "minioStorageSecretKey": "minioadmin",
    "sourceVolumeLocation": "/Users/bbollen23/loonar-data/minio-data"
  }
}
```

### General Settings

| Variable      | Details                                                                                             | Possible Values  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| "useHttp"     | Set to true if using HTTP is desired. If set to false, NGINX settings will be required.             | true/false       |
| "environment" | If set to 'production', will use MinIO features. Setting to 'local' will enable Local Loon instead. | production/local |
| "baseUrl"     | Base URL for application. Set this to "localhost" when using locally.                               | string           |

### MySQL Settings

| Variable               | Details                             | Possible Values |

| "databaseRootPassword" | Password for root user              | string          |

### MinIO Settings

MinIO Settings can be removed when the `generalSettings.environment` is set to `local`.

| Variable                | Details                                                                                                              | Possible Values        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |

### NGINX Settings

NGINX settings can be added by adding `"nginxSettings"` as a top level key. This is only required when `generalSettings.useHtp` is set to `false`.

| Variable               | Details                                               | Possible Values |

### Local Data Settings

Local Data settings can be added by adding `"localDataSettings"` as a top level key. This is only required when `generalSettings.environment` is set to `"local"`.

| "sourceVolumeLocation" | Location for the local data to be mounted to container. | string          |

The build script will do its best to validate each of these fields before starting the docker container. When running the build script, there are several inputs you can use

| Argument             | Description                                                                                                                                      | Example               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| -h, --help           | Outputs this information to terminal without running script.                                                                                     | -h                    |
| -v, --verbose        | All output response is sent to the terminal and main log file. If not present, limited information will be passed to the terminal.               | -v                    |
| -d, --detached       | Once all containers are started, program will exit and log in the background                                                                     | -d                    |
| -e, --validate-build | When present, the script will not build or start any containers. Only the configuration file will be validated and the environment file created. | -e                    |
| --env-file           | Name of env file to create.                                                                                                                      | .env, .env.production |
| --config-file        | Name of config file to use as input                                                                                                              | config.json           |
| -D, --down           | Stops all containers and removes all containers. Note that this will not build or start containers nor validate the configuration file.          | -D                    |
| -o, --overwrite      | When set, any settings in your configuration file which are present as environment variables in the current session will be overwritten.         | -o                    |

In the repository, you will see two docker directories: `docker` and `docker-local`. The main deployment will use the `docker` directory. The `docker-local` directory is a separate local version of Loon which we will discuss shortly. Below are some examples.

```bash
python3 build.py
```

The above script will build and then run all containers using a default of "config.json" as the configuration file and creating a ".env" file in the `.build-files` directory.

**Specifying the env file name and configuration file name**

```bash
python3 build.py --env-file .env.production --config-file config-production.json
```

This will use the "config-production.json" as the input configuration file and output a ".env.production" environment file.

**Using Detached Mode and Verbose**

```bash
python3 build.py -vd
```

This will enable verbose mode so that we can see the build process as it runs. It will also exit once all containers have begun running.

**Overwritting configuration file with environment variables**

```bash
export LOCALDATASETTINGS_SOURCEVOLUMELOCATION=/Users/MyUser/my-loon-data
python3 build -o
```

This will take your current config (in this case `config.json` in the root directory since no file name was specified) and overwrite the `localDataSettings.sourceVolumeLocation` value to be `/Users/MyUser/my-loon-data`. The original `config.json` will not be altered. Instead, a temporary file (in this case named `config.json.temp`) will be created and then used.

If you're using the script not in detached mode, then pressing "Ctrl+C" in the terminal will stop and remove all docker containers. Additionally, all logs will be outputted to a "logs" directory. For each run of the build script, a new directory called `logs_%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S` will be created with logging for each individual service separated.
